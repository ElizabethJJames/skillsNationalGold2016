may also create your own graphics to incorporate in the ad as well.
The graphic marketing ad is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your design and

font and messaging be visually compelling, be readable and simple to understand
and digest in 3 seconds.

message of the organization based on all of the information that you
have been provided.

your folders. If you do not name your folders per that requested format, you will
